				   IMAPFilter

Description

  IMAPFilter is a mail filtering utility. It connects to remote mail servers
  using the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), sends searching queries to
  the server and processes mailboxes based on the results. It can be used to
  delete, copy, move, flag, etc. messages residing in mailboxes at the same or
  different mail servers. The 4rev1 and 4 versions of the IMAP protocol are
  supported.

  IMAPFilter uses the Lua programming language as a configuration and extension
  language.

Changes

  All the changes in each new release up to the latest are in the NEWS file.


Installation

  Compile time requirements are Lua (version 5.3 or 5.2 or 5.1), the PCRE
  library, and the OpenSSL library.

  Compile and install the program:

    make all
    make install
    
  On illumos (and potentially on Solaris) you need these additional steps
  before compilation:
    - modify PATH with GNU tools before the native ones (/usr/local/gnu)
    - modify Makefile with:
      CC = gcc
      MYLIBS = -lsocket
      LIBDIRS = -L/usr/local/lib


Documentation

  There is detailed description of the command line options in the
  imapfilter(1) manual page, and of the configuration file format in the
  imapfilter_config(5) manual page.
  
  There are also more configuration examples in the samples/config.lua file,
  and some examples of extensions through Lua in the samples/extend.lua file.
